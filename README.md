# Spell_checker_LLM01
I wanted to create a 'prototype' spell checker by **fine-tuning** different LLMs models.
I prepared some data and also downloaded some public **datasets** from Kaggle: 

        https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/spelling?resource=download&select=aspell.txt

You will find:

· *archive.zip* : the dataset I downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/spelling?resource=download&select=aspell.txt

· *.csv file*: a sample of mispelled sentences and well spelled sentences.

· *.ipynb* : Python code to fine-tune a LLM and to evaluate it as well. I also used ChatGPT to improve/develop it.

I have also explored another prototype you may find in my repo: Spellchecker_LLM02. It is a more finegrained approach, where more sentences are used, instead of a mix of words and sentences, which may had led to problems because of different length of each sample during training.
